## üë§ User Base

This is designed to simplify the creation of NACHA-compliant ACH files for SMEs, Banks and financial institutions, We also provide tailored solutons for specific requirements. 


## How it Works

The ACH Generator provides two main ways to input transaction details:

### üìä User Interface

The **User Interface** allows users to manually input transaction details for a single transaction. If multiple transactions need to be processed, a CSV file can be uploaded.

- **Manual Input**: Users can enter transaction details such as receiver's name, account number, and amount.
- **CSV Upload**: Users can upload a CSV file containing transaction data. The tool will automatically convert it into the proper format for ACH files.

#### Sender Details
Sender details can be configured using the "Company Details" tab:

#### Receiver Details
Receiver details can be entered in the "ACH Generator" tab. Once the transaction is ready, clicking the "Generate ACH" button will generate the ACH file, which can then be downloaded.
