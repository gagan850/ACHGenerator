## How it Works

1. **Input Method**:
   - **User Interface**: Enter transaction details through the interactive UI (Currently, It supports only Single Transaction).
   - **CSV Input**: Upload a CSV file containing single or multiple transactions data. The tool will read the CSV and convert it to a compliant ACH file.

2. **CSV Formats Supported**:
   - The tool can handle CSV files in various formats, including those used for payroll, vendor payments, or other financial transactions.

3. **ACH File Generation**:
   - Once the input data is provided (via UI or CSV), the ACH Generator creates a file that conforms to the NACHA format, which can be used for submitting payments to your bank.
